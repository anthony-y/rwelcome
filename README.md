# rwelcome

What I see when I turn on my laptop.

Welcome screen for Linux terminals showing system info such as CPU temperature, uptime, and kernel version. It's also possible to display weather information - but you need an API key from https://www.weatherapi.com.

Also shows a list of to-do items read from a file in:

`/home/ant/.local/share/rwelcome/todos`

This project is a re-write of an older version implemented in C. You can view that repository's source here:
